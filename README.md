# What is OPERATION: QuaranTeam?
Unfortunately we're in the midst of a global pandemic which has caused much of the world to implement quarantines in an effort to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Although this forced social distancing seperates all of us physically, technology allows us to be closer than ever. 

OPERATION: QuaranTeam is an attempt at coming together to hack together an open source project in a week that will benefit the community for years to come, while also demonstrating how agile software development is conducted in organizations today. It's going to be great!

# What is the Project?
The internet has has all the information people need to become experts in a subject. The problem is that ANYONE can distribute information and it can be hard to determine if the information you have discovered is what you need, or even if its correct. This abundance of information also has no structure. I think we can curate it. 

We're going to be creating an Open Source platform for curating Open Source Courses using all the free content that already exists out there. Think [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), or [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) but FREE!

We even have an name for this project! It's called SYNAPSE! A synapse is a structure that permits a neuron to pass information to other neurons. SYNAPSE will be the structure that permits a person to pass infromation to other people.

## What can you expect to learn

This is much larger than just writing software. We'll be practing all aspects of agile software development, with experts giving insights and filling in roles such as Product Manager and Scrum Master. We'll learn how to approach taking a software project from idea to product. Should you participate, you can expect to know the following once the week is done:

- What are Agile and Scrum and how they can be used to effectively manage a software project
- Concepts in Product Management
- Where and How design fits into a "Software" project
- What DevOps is and how it can be implemented to enable faster software delivery
- All types of technical concepts. Here are a few to get you excited:
  - Somewhere between 3 and 112 Services from Amazon Web Services
  - Real life Git foo 
  - How to configure a terminal that is so beautiful it's almost NSFW
- Concepts in Software Testing and how it fits into "Software" projects
